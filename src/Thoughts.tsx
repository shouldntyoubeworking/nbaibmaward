          Without modern data modeling, this formula really only values specific counting stats that people found relevant in that moment in time.
          And it doesn't really do a good job of assessing a player's value to their team. Modern sabermetrics, as flawed as they are, trounce this award in every way imaginable. 
          But it was a pioneer so I guess it gets points for it. PER also sucks for the same reason.
